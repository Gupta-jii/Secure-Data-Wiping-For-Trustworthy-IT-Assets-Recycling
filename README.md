# Secure-Data-Wiping-For-Trustworthy-IT-Assets-Recycling
A cross-platform data eraser tool (Windows, Linux, Android) that also offers a digitally signed certificate of erasure. Constructed to address India's e-waste problem by allowing users to have the verifiable evidence they require to recycle devices with confidence. This repository holds the interactive MVP simulation.
CleanWipe: Safe Data Erasing for Reliable IT Asset Recycling
An easy-to-use, cross-platform data eraser aimed at establishing trust and openness in the IT asset recycling and disposal process, addressing India's huge e-waste problem.

The Issue: A Crisis of Fear and Waste
India is struggling with a twofold crisis: a rapidly increasing e-waste mountain and a common fear of data loss.

Massive E-Waste: India currently produces more than 3 million tonnes of e-waste every year, which is increasing at a rapid pace.

Locked Economic Value: More than ₹50,000 crore worth of fully recyclable IT assets (laptops, phones, etc.) are stockpiled in homes and offices.

The Root Cause: The main cause of this hoarding is the belief that individual or business information can be restored from discarded devices. Current data sanitizing tools are typically too cumbersome, costly, or do not feature an auditable "proof of erasure."

Our Solution: CleanWipe - Trust-in-a-Click
CleanWipe is a bootable, secure data wiping tool available for all. It spans the trust gap by providing easy, accessible, and, more importantly, verifiable military-grade data destruction.

Our purpose is to empower every person and organization with the confidence to recycle their devices safely, tapping into the vast economic value and fostering a sustainable circular economy.

Core Features
???? Secure & Standards-Compliant: Enforces widely accepted standards such as NIST SP 800-88 and DoD 5220.22-M.

???? Cross-Platform: One tool for Windows, Linux, and Android platforms, with each optimized wiping strategy.

???? Verifiable Certificate: Produces a digitally signed, tamper-proof certificate of data destruction after each wipe—our biggest innovation.

???? Offline & Portable: Operates from a bootable USB, with no need to install and functioning even on PCs with corrupted operating systems.

???? Intelligent Wiping: Automatically identifies drive types (HDD, SSD, NVMe, eMMC) and suggests the most effective sanitization process.

???? Enterprise Ready: Bulk wiping, audit logs, and chain of custody tracking are just a few features that make it perfect for enterprise-level IT asset disposal.

How It Works: The CleanWipe Workflow
Our workflow is simple yet extremely powerful, with security at every turn from the device's boot to the export of the final, auditable certificate.
